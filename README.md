# qGauss_luminosity
**Luminosity for q-Gaussian distribution functions in the transverse plane, for identical beams colliding head-on**\
See Mathematica notebook for the solution of the lumi integrals:Lumiqgauss.nb\
See python script for the impact of the tails on the luminosity, for various cases, together with the validation when comparing to Gaussian luminosities: Lumi_qGaussian_cases.ipynb
***
The analytical luminosity calculation for q-Gaussian distribtuions (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07317.pdf) is based on:\
    -q-Gaussian sigmas of the distributions\
    -on some integrals that are functions of the parameter q of the q-Gaussian distribution

-> the 2 beams are assumed to be equal for simplicity...better if each beam is treated separately \
-> needs to be improved by adding the contribution of xing
