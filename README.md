# qGauss_luminosity
Luminosity for q-Gaussian distribution functions in the transverse plane\
See Mathematica notebook for the solution of the lumi integrals:Lumiqgauss.nb\
See python script for the impact of the tails on the luminosity, for various cases, together with the validation when comparing to Gaussian luminosities: Lumi_qGaussian_cases.ipynb
